We need 3 subnets for each department and 3 vlans due to one switch connection


Base network: 192.168.1.0
No. of subnets > 3
No. of Subnets > 2^n=3 (we can use 3 or more, due to the formula we can't use n=1 due to less subnets so we will use n=2, this will give us 4 subnets - we rather have more than less.)

Borrowing bits for the subnets - 11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000 (11000000 = the 2 borrowed subnets which is 192 with a 64 IP range).
