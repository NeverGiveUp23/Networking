
This network project is for a SOHO. The requirements were 3 vlans for Finance, Reception, and Admin departments.
Each department had it's own subnet along with an AP for wireless devices.
The Base Network requested is 192.168.1.0 with a total of 3 subnets. Giving us 192.168.1.0/26




This first image displays the Logical network connection of the SOHO, You can see the labeling for each department as well as the wireless devices connecting to the AP. Each device has been configured to join the DHCP network that I implemented to be within it's required range.
