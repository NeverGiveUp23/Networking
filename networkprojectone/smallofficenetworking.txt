The small office network that I built is a simple one, requiring two subnets, one for Accounting and one for Delivery.


The IP for these need to start with 192.168.40.0

With the two subnets I used the basic subnet formula of 2^n = n, while n = the no. of subnets

Subnets landed on 255.255.255.128

I was tasks to input static IP Ranges for each department. Each department needs 2 or more Computers and at least 1 printer.

So department Accounts I set the ranges from 192.168.40.1-192.168.40.126 with the Network ID being 192.168.40.0, and the broadcast ID being 192.168.40.127 respectively.

In department Delivery I set the ranges from 192.168.40.129-192.168.40.254 with the Netywork ID being 192.168.40.128 and the Broadcast ID being 192.168.40.255 respectively
